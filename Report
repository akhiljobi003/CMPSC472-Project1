The code is a implementaion of an operating system that includes a multi process and thread task manager, 
inter process communication, parallel mathematical operations, and a simple UI. The code defines constants
like max number of threads or max number of processes. Then it defines the structure of different thread 
information such as ID and number of threads. Then there is a function to display the information about 
thread and process, process text files, and simulating IPC using shared memory. The main function 
initializes an array to store process information and implements a simple menu driven interface, such as 
create new process, simulate IPC, process text file, and display information. Overall the code demonstrates
concepts of process and thread creation, IPC using shared memory and file processing. Some challanges I 
faced was handling file operations such as opening and rading the text files.
