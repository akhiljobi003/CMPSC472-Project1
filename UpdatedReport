The code is a C program that implement an operating system that includes a multi process and thread task manager, inter process communication, parallel mathematical operations, and a simple UI. The program includes several standard C header files for various functionalities such as input/output, memory allocation, threading, inter-process communication, and string manipulation. Several global constants are defined, including the maximum number of threads and processes, the maximum message size, and buffer size for file processing. The program defines three structures: ThreadInfo to store thread information, ProcessInfo to store process information, and SharedMemory to define the structure of shared memory for IPC. The main function presents a menu-driven interface, allowing users to create new processes and threads, simulate IPC over processes and threads, process text files, display process and thread information, and manage processes and threads. For process management, the program allows users to kill, suspend, and resume processes, as well as create new threads within processes. Process suspension and resumption are achieved using the kill system call with the appropriate signals. Thread creation is facilitated by the pthread_create function. The program also provides functionality to terminate threads, suspend and resume threads within processes, and manage threads at the user level. In the IPC simulation, the program demonstrates shared memory operations for both processes and threads. For IPC over processes, shared memory segments are created and accessed by multiple processes, with semaphore usage for synchronization. For IPC over threads, shared memory and semaphores are used within thread functions to simulate message passing. Overall the code demonstrates concepts of process and thread creation, IPC using shared memory and file processing, as well as IPC concepts in a Unix-like environment. Some challanges I faced was handling file operations such as opening and reading the text files, and managing threads within processes when considering thread synchronization, and deadlock avoidance.  fnfn
